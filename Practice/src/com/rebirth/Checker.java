	 * HashSet is Implemented using a hash table. Elements are not ordered. The add,
	 * remove, and contains methods have constant time complexity O(1).
	 * 
	 * TreeSet is implemented using a tree structure(red-black tree in algorithm
	 * book). The elements in a set are sorted, but the add, remove, and contains
	 * methods has time complexity O(log (n)). It offers several methods to deal
	 * with the ordered set like first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet(), etc.
	 * 
	 * 1) First major difference between HashSet and TreeSet is performance. HashSet
	 * is faster than TreeSet and should be preferred choice if sorting of element
	 * is not required.
	 * 
	 * 2) Second difference between HashSet and TreeSet is that HashSet allows null
	 * object but TreeSet doesn't allow null Object and throw NullPointerException,
	 * Why, because TreeSet uses compareTo() method to compare keys and compareTo()
	 * will throw java.lang.NullPointerException.
	 * 
	 * 3) Another significant difference between HashSet and TreeSet is that ,
	 * HashSet is backed by HashMap while TreeSet is backed by TreeMap in Java.
	 * 
	 * 4) One more difference between HashSet and TreeSet which is worth remembering
	 * is that HashSet uses equals() method to compare two object in Set and for
	 * detecting duplicates while TreeSet uses compareTo() method for same purpose.
	 * if equals() and compareTo() are not consistent, i.e. for two equal object
	 * equals should return true while compareTo() should return zero, than it will
	 * break contract of Set interface and will allow duplicates in Set
	 * implementations like TreeSet
	 * 
	 * 5) Now most important difference between HashSet and TreeSet is ordering.
	 * HashSet doesn't guaranteed any order while TreeSet maintains objects in
	 * Sorted order defined by either Comparable or Comparator method in Java.
	 * 
	 * 6) TreeSet does not allow to insert Heterogeneous objects. It will throw
	 * classCastException at Runtime if trying to add hetrogeneous objects, whereas
	 * HashSet allows hetrogeneous objects.
